Course-Registration-System
A course registration system (CRS) created using object oriented programming (java).

==============

Fulfills the following requirements:

The CRS stores the following information about each course:
course name
course ID
max numer of students registered in the course
current number of registered students
list of names of students being registered in the course
course conducting department
course section number
The CRS allows two types of users: Admin and Student (User)
The CRS allows the Admin to perform the following tasks:
Course Management
Create a new course
Delete a course
Edit a course (except for course ID and name)
Display info for a course (by course ID)
Register a student (allows admin to add student w/o assigning to a course)
Exit
Reports
View all courses (for every course display list of enrolled students' names, ids, # of students registered, max number of students allowed to be registered)
View all full courses
Write to a file list of full courses
View names of students registered to specific course
View list of courses a student is registered in (given first & last name of student)
Sort courses on current number of students registered
Exit
The CRS allows the Student to perform the following tasks:
Course Management
View all courses
View all courses that are NOT full
Register in a course (student enters course name, section, student's full name)
Withdraw from a course (student enters their name, course name)
View all courses student is registered in
Exit
The CRS must implement the following design:
An Interface for admin class with signatures of methods used by admin.
An Interface for student class with signatures of methods used by student.
Both Admin and Student classes inherit from class User. User has the following class members:
username
password
first & last name
When program is launched, the CRS must read all courses' information from a file (myuniversitycourses.csv).
Assume there is only one Admin in the program.
Serialization & deserialization will be used to read the csv file and write into a new file.
